#Get a Lyric React App

Get inspired from notable song lyrics

##Summary

A React.js App on WordPress which displays individual songs quotes and artists (blog posts) on a single page.

A new song quote is shown when the "Get a Lyric" button is clicked. This is achieved through WordPress' REST API functionality and accessing post data with the json object.

Initially, I used jQuery to iterate over the array but found it to be unresponsive at times and slow. Instead, I decided to implement the functionality using React.js and got a much faster load and instant response.
